Found a nice coworking space in Nha Trang, Vietnam: [LivinCollective](http://livincollective.tumblr.com/). Check [the map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/LIVINcollective/@12.24055,109.191345,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x9e9b8620219644fb?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjP8PHApbvLAhVTGo4KHf4_CxcQ_BIIcTAK). The place is comfortable, the hosts are really friendly. Working there is free, but it would be great if you buy something (juice or coffee or something to eat) to help run the place. WiFi there was the fastest I had in Nha Trang :)

Some pictures of the place:
